Database project for AC32007. 

In the specification given to us, we are tasked to explore a conceptual and logical design of a relational database. Initially, in group 4 we visualized a concept of an international shipping company. We immediately began arguing over the semantics and methodologies which would adequately fulfil the requirements of being global in perspective, applicable to a relational database, possessive of the potential for an attractive front end, and designed for several categories of main user. Our first choice of application was as an electronics manufacturer and shipping corporation, however it was decided that encompassing a manufacturing aspect in a relational database would have been unnecessary to meet the project requirements while also encompassing a shipping aspect, so we decided to ignore any manufacturing aspects of a corporation and the relational database entities that would apply and stick to the logistics instead.

Our concept, which we decided would be called ‘T.W.A.R.T Shipping Corporation’, has been visualized as an international shipping organization on a huge scale. The concept applies in depth to relational database key factors such as storing transactions long term, keeping track of employee records, our vehicle fleet, and operational jurisdiction. A huge boon to business is available in the recording of clientele and organizing contracts, and it is necessary to have a relational database to ensure this is performed to success. 

Our logistics concept has the potential for a huge field-leading web based front end, ensuring that all the latest in web technology can be used to provide a high quality service for our clientele. Our main users will be corporate consumers, our shipping concept will not be available for an individual. Corporate consumers include but are not limited to:

•	Electronics Manufacturers 
•	Flat-packed furnishers
•	Construction Supplies
•	Raw Materials

Our database will allow multiple demographics from the clientele and our own employees to have different views of the database. For example, our own employees, on the logistics side will be able to access views of the depots locations, and cargo/goods information. The accountancy employees will be able to see views of the transactions, contracts, staff details, banking information and orders. As for the clients listed above, views of the services we provide will be available, such as our different priorities of shipping, our cheapest options or shipping with tracking information.

Taking into consideration the geo-political situation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland we have to make amends for certain situations. A benefit offered by our shipping corporation is our depot based in Northern Ireland. The taxation of logistics from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and, Northern Ireland internationally to the Republic Ireland is higher than the taxation of logistics from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. Our depot based in Northern Ireland can ship to clientele in the Republic of Ireland cheaper than our competitors who would otherwise only offer international rates. 

Any logistics which are to take place outside of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland must be sourced by a third party corporation. The scope of our tracking, vehicle fleet and employees are limited mostly to the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland. However this does not mean that our services is detrimental on an international scale, as only the highest quality of third party couriers will be sourced by our employees. Also, there is a huge market to expand our shipping into by building depots and establishing trade routes in international locations. Our high quality UK based logistic scheme and management techniques will be highly sought after worldwide.

Our logistics concept in a relational database will have goods, packages package specifications, accounts, banking, and orders to fully handle clientele transactions, and to support the analysis of purchasing and shipping patterns to advance our business. Our relational database concept also includes depots and clients to ensure a progressive business model and to support long term decision making. By analyzing the necessity of depots and their locations nationwide we can apply marketing algorithms to discover the feasibility of new expansions in the business. 

In summary, after initially over thinking the project and planning a concept of too much complexity, we managed to derive a suitable idea. ‘T.W.A.R.T Shipping Corporation’ will be provide a level of professionalism and expertise unseen in the logistics field. International shipping to all corners of the globe will be available with many different choices of shipping speeds and costs. This will all be achievable through a relational database and the views that provides to the corporation and its clientele.
